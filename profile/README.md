AdonisJS is a **fully-featured** backend framework for Node.js. The framework is created from ground-up with strong emphasis on developer ergonomics and ease of use.

It is one of the rarest framework in the Node.js community that ships with a suite of first party packages that helps you create and ship products without wasting hundreds of hours in assembling different npm packages.

## Features
Following are some hand-picked features from the framework core and first party packages.

- [HTTP layer](https://docs.adonisjs.com/guides/concepts/http-overview#the-http-layer) with support for **routing**, **middleware**, **session**, **secure cookies**, and a lot more.
- Support for [file uploads](https://docs.adonisjs.com/guides/file-uploads).
- [Filesystem drive](https://docs.adonisjs.com/guides/digging-deeper/drive) to move user uploaded files to cloud services like S3, GCS and Digital ocean.
